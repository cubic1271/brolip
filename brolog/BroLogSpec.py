    Bro Log Specification.  This class is the base object for different types of log backends supported by Bro.
    LogSpec objects are responsible for opening, maintaining, and determining the types of various files (as
    identified by file extensions registered in __init__.py).

    Since some forms of SQL databases require a connection string rather than a file path, a TODO item
    is to add prefix support to paths (e.g. mysql:file_with_connection_string).  The details of retrieving
    file types and other data from each column and converting that into appropriate bro types is something
    of a design challenge, however, so this is something that probably needs some amount of thought before
    it is implemented.
